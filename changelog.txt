1.0.5: Fix hang that occurs if partial dependency plot data are too large by always writing them
       to an external file.  This has the added benefit of removing them from the classic output.

1.0.4 Repair partial dependency plots (make sure numeric data are interpreted as numeric).

1.0.3 Add new $SEQUENCE command (currently supported only for single TreeNet models).

1.0.2: Repairs required to run under OSX (bugs should have broken the Linux port too).

1.0.1: In AUTOMATE summary tables, if more than five variable names are listed
       in a cell, then replace the names with a count of the number of
       variables.

1.0.0: Initial release
